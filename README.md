This project is an analysis of the most optimal skills for Data Analyst positions, inspired by a video by Luke Barousse on SQL programming. As a beginner passionate about data science, this very first project allowed me to dive into the world of data analysis using SQL and PostgreSQL.

# QUESTIONS THAT GOVERNED MY ANALYSIS
As a self-taught data scientist, I was looking to understand which skills are most valuable for a Data Analyst. To do this, I followed Luke Barousse's project, where he explores the most in-demand and best-paid skills for this role. The main questions that guided my analysis are:

* What are the highest paying jobs for my role?
* What skills are required for these high paying positions?
* What skills are in high demand for my role?
* What skills pay the highest for my role?
* What skills are most optimal to learn?

**What are the skills required for these high-paying positions?**

The skills required for these high-paying Data Analyst jobs are mainly focused on:

-Proficiency in programming languages ​​for data analysis: Python and R.

-Data manipulation and specific tool skills: SQL, Pandas, PySpark, Jupyter, and Excel.

-Familiarity with cloud computing platforms: Azure, Databricks, and AWS.

**What are the most in-demand skills for my role?**

The most in-demand skills for the Data Analyst job are SQL, Tableau, Python, Excel, and R, with SQL being the most in-demand, followed closely by Tableau and Python.

**What are the highest paying skills for my role?**

The highest paying skills for the Data Analyst role are Bitbucket, Angular, FastAPI, Keras, and PySpark, with the highest average annual salaries associated with these skills.

**What are the most optimal skills to learn?**

So the three most optimal skills are SQL, Python, NO SQL, when based on the two criteria of salaries, and the most in-demand skills.
